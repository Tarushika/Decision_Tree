Project Overview:-
Project Title: "Decision Tree Classifier for [Target Problem]"

Objective: "The objective of this project is to use the Decision Tree Classifier to predict [target variable]. This model uses various features such as [mention key features], and aims to classify data into different categories (e.g., spam or not spam, cancerous or non-cancerous, etc.). The project also evaluates the model using performance metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and visualizes the results using a heatmap."

Libraries Used:

Scikit-learn: For implementing the Decision Tree algorithm, model training, and evaluation.
Seaborn: For creating visually appealing statistical plots.
Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
Matplotlib: For custom plots and visualizations

Data Preprocessing:-
Data Cleaning:

"The dataset was cleaned by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing any inconsistencies."
Handling Missing Values:

"Missing data was handled using either imputation (filling missing values with the mean/median) or by removing rows/columns with missing values."
Feature Encoding:

"For categorical features, we used techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding to convert them into numerical representations."
Splitting the Dataset:

"The dataset was split into two parts:
Training set (80%): Used for model training.
Testing set (20%): Used for model evaluation."

 Model Evaluation:-
 Accuracy of the Model:
"The accuracy of the model was calculated by comparing the predicted values with the actual values from the test dataset."
"Accuracy is the ratio of correct predictions to total predictions."

Confusion Matrix:
"The confusion matrix was used to evaluate the performance of the classification model. It shows the counts of True Positives (TP), True Negatives (TN), False Positives (FP), and False Negatives (FN)."
"The confusion matrix helps assess the modelâ€™s ability to correctly classify each class."
